## User documentation

The documentation for usage can be found [here](doc/general.md), possible operations are listed [here](doc/operations.md).

## Deployment

All Javascript is client side, so you can simply clone the repository and open index.html in the browser. With newer browser this is not possible because of security rules on loading files and modules, so you might need to start a local server, for example with:

```python -m http.server```

You can find a deployed version [here](https://frcroth.de/zahlenmaschine/).
